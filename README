1. ABOUT Qcorr
Qcorr is a Digital Image Correlation (DIC) Program implemented in QT4
The following is a high-level overview of the program process:
Upon running the program, Qcorr, the user loads two images taken from a stereo vision camera preferably (or similar means). Afterwards, a rectangular template must be extracted from the left (reference) image. The user then can work on any of the two available modes of operation, namely for template-matching or pixel-disparity mapping. Qcorr's relevant correlation functionality is based on three popular methods: Cross Correlation, Sum of Squared Differences, and Correlation Coefficient. The template traverses the target image and computes the correlation according to the selected method. During this time, the program can also display maps of the resulting process, either a correlation map or disparity map, depending on the operation. Values for correlation levels, which vary upon the method, as well as coordinates of the best match are also provided. More details on the use of Qcorr are provided in the "Using Qcorr" section of this document. Before that, we address the mathematical derivations for the relevant correlation methods used in this project. 

2. PACKAGE DEPENDENCIES
In Linux, you n
  a) the QT4 framework, in ubuntu you can go to a Pakage manager or install as following via the terminal
    $ sudo apt-get install libqtcore4
  b) g++

3. COMPILING

In Linux, through the command line, navigate to the directory (here) where you unpackaged the tar.gz
  $ qmake Qcorr.pro    (pay attention to the capital "Q")
  $ make
Then, you can run Qcorr from here, by typing
  $ ./Qcorr
or
  $ [complete_path_to_Qcorr]/Qcorr

4. CLASSES DOCUMENTATION
Found in the "doc" folder of this package

5. REMARKS
The functionality is very basic and requires more actual usability since it is actual implementation is only a proof of concept on correlation methods and pixel-disparity.
Some basic methods of image correlation are implemented from the graceful source-code from Prof. G. Wolberg's IP_correlation procedure used in his extensive Image Processing Suite.
