Senior Capstone Project.

This Project is not thoroughly implemented, so please don't even bother looking at it. The functionality is very basic and requires a lot of work on its actual usability.

Some basic methods of image correlation are implemented from the graceful source-code from Prof. G. Wolberg's IP_correlation procedure used in his extensive Image Processing Suite.
